## ❓Why TriliumNext?

The original Trilium developer ([Zadam](https://github.com/zadam)) has graciously given the Trilium repository to the community project which resides at https://github.com/TriliumNext

### ⬆️Migrating from Zadam/Trilium?

There are no special migration steps to migrate from a zadam/Trilium instance to a TriliumNext/Trilium instance. Simply [install TriliumNext/Trilium](#-installation) as usual and it will use your existing database.

Versions up to and including [v0.90.4](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/tag/v0.90.4) are compatible with the latest zadam/trilium version of [v0.63.7](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/releases/tag/v0.63.7). Any later versions of TriliumNext/Trilium have their sync versions incremented which prevents direct migration.

## 🏗 Installation

### Windows / MacOS

Download the binary release for your platform from the [latest release page](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/latest), unzip the package and run the `trilium` executable.

### Linux

If your distribution is listed in the table below, use your distribution's package.

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/triliumnext.svg)](https://repology.org/project/triliumnext/versions)

You may also download the binary release for your platform from the [latest release page](https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/releases/latest), unzip the package and run the `trilium` executable.

TriliumNext is also provided as a Flatpak, but not yet published on FlatHub.

### Browser (any OS)

If you use a server installation (see below), you can directly access the web interface (which is almost identical to the desktop app).

Currently only the latest versions of Chrome & Firefox are supported (and tested).

### Mobile

To use TriliumNext on a mobile device, you can use a mobile web browser to access the mobile interface of a server installation (see below).

See issue https://github.com/TriliumNext/Trilium/issues/4962 for more information on mobile app support.

If you prefer a native Android app, you can use [TriliumDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/eu.fliegendewurst.triliumdroid).
Report bugs and missing features at [their repository](https://github.com/FliegendeWurst/TriliumDroid).
Note: It is best to disable automatic updates on your server installation (see below) when using TriliumDroid since the sync version must match between Trilium and TriliumDroid.

### Server

To install TriliumNext on your own server (including via Docker from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/triliumnext/trilium)) follow [the server installation docs](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/server-installation).
